# Interview Exercise - Full Stack Developer

## Application Functionality:

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple contacts app that interacts with a REST API and displays data in a usable fashion.

- Display all contacts
  - Phone numbers should be properly formatted
  - Ability to filter contacts by name
- Add new contact
- Delete contact

### Contact model

- Name
- Phone Number (E.164 format)

E.164 format enforced by regex on contact model


### Extra Functionality (Not Required):

- Edit contact
- Add image to contact model


## Django Tastypie

The app used Django Tastypie to manage the API. It is more lightweight than Django Rest Framework and after a period of stagnation is back in active development.



## Implementation Requirements

- The backend has to be developed with Django + Django REST Framework (API errors should be handled appropriately).
- The frontend has to be developed with Angular and must communicate with the backend through the REST API.
- Use (or donâ€™t use) any CSS framework you wish to create a pleasing UI.

## Notes

* Please provide a README with any instructions on how to run or compile your code.
* While the main goal is evaluating the code quality, your code will be run and tested.



### Deployment instructions
